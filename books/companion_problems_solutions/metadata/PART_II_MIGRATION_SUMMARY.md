# Companion Part II migration — Volume II problem corpus

This pass materializes the Volume II semantic atlas rows as reader-facing Companion problems.
Source provenance, classification confidence, and alternate solution variants remain in the migration ledger rather than the mathematical prose.

## Coverage

- Part II atlas units: **570**
- Reader-facing problems migrated: **570**
- Editorial holds with no safely recoverable statement: **0**
- Problems with a migrated primary solution: **165**
- Atlas rows marked as having a reconciled solution: **165**
- Expected solutions not safely recovered in this pass: **0**
- Problems with multiple distinct solution variants retained in provenance: **19**
- Atlas placement-review rows included in Part II: **312**

## Reader-facing thematic sections

- Metric and Topological Foundations (II/01--II/07): **132** problems
- Calculus (II/08--II/10): **51** problems
- Sequences of Functions (II/11--II/15): **338** problems
- Fixed Points and Differential Equations (II/16--II/19): **23** problems
- Approximation (II/20--II/25): **26** problems

## Visual layer

No new plots or diagrams are introduced in this migration commit.
Existing/source visual requirements remain recorded in `COMPANION_PROBLEM_ATLAS.tsv` and `PART_II_MIGRATION.tsv` for the later visual-enrichment pass.

## Integrity rule

Every Part I atlas unit has exactly one migration-ledger row and therefore one explicit disposition.
No missing statement or solution is fabricated.
